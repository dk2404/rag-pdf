# Retrieval Augmented Generative Code from PDF Source

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation for retrieving information from PDF source files and utilizing it to augment generative tasks. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this code extracts relevant information from PDF documents and integrates it into generative processes, enhancing the richness and relevance of generated content.

## Key Features
- Extraction of text data from PDF source files.
- Implementation of retrieval-augmented generative models.
- Seamless integration with Jupyter Notebooks for interactive usage and experimentation.
- Compatible with various PDF formats and structures.
- Easily adaptable for different generative tasks and domains.

## Usage
1. Upload your PDF source file.
2. Execute the provided code in the Jupyter Notebook to extract and preprocess text data.
3. Employ retrieval-augmented techniques to enhance generative tasks.
4. Experiment with different configurations and models for varied outputs.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PDFMiner (for PDF parsing)
- Transformer-based models (e.g., Hugging Face's Transformers library)
